# Markdown
+ Markdown is useful way to make notes for youself as you learn Python.
+ You can store code snippets neatly for quick recall:

```python
>>> python_rocks = True
>>> def my_function(str):
...     """Demonstrate how cool syntax highlighting is!"""
...     if python_rocks:
...         for n in range(5):
...             print(str+("!"*n))
...         else:
...             pass # Of course it's true!
...     return
... 
>>> my_function("Python rocks")
Python rocks
Python rocks!
Python rocks!!
Python rocks!!!
Python rocks!!!!
```
