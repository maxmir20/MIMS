    "\n",
    "If i is ever an 'e', then an if statement will add it to the variable e_count. At the end of the for loop (once i has run through every character in the string), the program evaluates e_count.

    "Assuming a phrase is entered into print_no_e, I use the split function to turn it into a list called a_string. I then set the variable e_total equal to the length of the a_string (so I have a count of all the words in the original string). Then I use a 'for' loop to evaluate each index of a_string using the no_e function. If the no_e function is true, then I add the word to another list called e_list(which is meant to hold all the words that don't have 'e' in them), I also add +1 to a variable called e_count. Once the 'for' loop is done, I then do a for loop for e_list so each word is printed out on a new line. At the very end, I divide the e_count (number of words without 'e') by the e_total (total number of words in the string) and multiply it by 100 to give me the percentage."

    "### Diagnosis\n",
    "This one was definitely the most interesting problem to solve for this session. \n",
    "\n",
    "The avoids and forbidden_prompt functions were both fairly easy to put together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 3rd problem of finding the smallest excluded words, several problems needed to be addressed:\n",
    "1. Excluded vs. Included and string input: this was the easiest problem to solve. The previous functions provided a list of words that weren't excluded, while in this case we're looking for the number of excluded words. In this case I found it was easier to make a modified version of the forbidden_prompt function called forbidden_prompt_alt that would return a count of excluded words instead. I also made it so it could accept a string argument, so forbidden letters could be passed into it. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Finding smallest combination: this was difficult for a number of reasons. Originally, I thought the best solution was to evaluate each letter to identify the top 5 letters that excluded the fewest amount of words. Once you had those letters, you can combine them into a string and run that through and see how many were excluded. This led to other problems, Which are identified below.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Sorting: In order to determine the top 5 least excluded letters, you would need to first run each letter to return all the numbers, then sort from lowest to highest. If you don't tie it to the letters however, then you won't be able to identify it once you've sorted them. The solution in this case was to create a nested list that contains both the letter and the output, then sorting only by the output. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Duplicates: While I originally thought that that solution would be adequate for the problem, it was pointed out to me by my classmates that this wouldn't account for instances in which letters could overlap each other in terms of words excluded. Even by taking the combination smallest letters, it was possible that they would each be excluding separate words, wheres another combination would have more overlap in the words they excluded, potentially lowering the total number of excluded words. In order to test this, I worked with my classmates to combine two forms of code. The first one, noted above, would find the top 5 least excluded letters, then generate the total number from that combination. Using that number as a baseline, we would then compare that against the number of excluded words for each letter. If any letters excluded more words than the combination, it was disqualified. Using this new list of letters than fell under the baseline, I used an itertools.combinations function to create a list of all possible variations and compared each result against the baseline. If a combination was found that would be greater, then it would replace the existing baseline and form a new one."
